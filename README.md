### groundwork
Welcome to my GitHub profile! This README.md document serves as a guide to the labelling system I've implemented to easily identify important coding concepts that require further study over time. With this system, each file name is accompanied by a relevant label, allowing me to quickly spot and prioritize the codes I need to revisit.

Labelling System
ðŸ’¤ ### Dormant:
Codes I worked on while feeling tired or sleepy, perhaps not at my best. These may require extra attention and revision.

ðŸ«µ ### Pride of Work:
Exceptional code that I am particularly proud of. It showcases my skills and represents a notable achievement.

ðŸ¦– ### Key Concepts:
Codes that demonstrate important concepts and techniques I need to remember. Revisiting these helps solidify my understanding.

âŒ› ### Frequent Review:
Codes that require regular review as I tend to forget or struggle with certain aspects. Consistent practice will help reinforce my knowledge.

Feel free to explore my repositories and discover the various codes tagged with these labels. I hope you find this labelling system useful and gain insights into my learning journey. Happy coding!
